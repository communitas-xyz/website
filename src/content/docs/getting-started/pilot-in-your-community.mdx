You don't need a platform to start building a healthier community. You need intention, one clear goal, and a willingness to experiment.

Here's how to begin.

## Step 1: Name what matters

Pick one outcome you care about. Not "engagement" — something specific:

- **Newcomer retention**: Are new members still active after two weeks?
- **Cross-group collaboration**: Do people from different clusters ever work together?
- **Moderation load**: Is conflict concentrated, escalating, or shifting?
- **Participation breadth**: Are the same five people doing everything?

Write it down. This is your pilot's success criterion.

## Step 2: Map your community

You don't need software for this. Sketch it out:

- **Who talks to whom?** Where are the clusters? Are there groups that never interact?
- **Who bridges them?** Which people show up across multiple groups or conversations?
- **Where do newcomers enter?** And where do they drop off?

Even a rough map reveals structure you've been navigating by instinct — a bridge node who's overloaded, a cluster drifting away, an onboarding gap you hadn't named.

## Step 3: Try one small experiment

Pick one intervention and run it for two to four weeks:

- **Bridge-building**: Introduce two people from different clusters around a shared interest or project. One warm introduction per week is enough.
- **Onboarding**: Create a "first three steps" path for newcomers — where to introduce yourself, what to read first, who to ask for help — and assign a mentor or buddy.
- **Facilitation**: Try a new ritual. Weekly discussion prompts, recognition rounds, or brief conflict check-ins. Small, repeatable, low-stakes.

Start with one. Resist the urge to redesign everything at once.

## Step 4: Review what happened

After your experiment window, look at what changed — and be honest about what didn't:

- Did the people you introduced actually talk again?
- Did newcomers who got the onboarding path stick around longer?
- Did cross-group conversations increase? Did conflict go down, or shift?

Don't just count activity. Ask whether relationships formed, whether trust grew, whether the community felt different to the people in it.

This is what intentional community building looks like. Communitas is being built to help you instrument these loops — map your network, suggest interventions, track outcomes, and learn from what works. But the thinking starts with you.
