# Understand and improve your community with auditable AI

Communitas helps you see how your community actually works — who connects whom, where newcomers fall through the cracks, and which small interventions improve health over time.

It combines dynamic network analysis, language modeling, and a research-backed experiment toolkit to support community managers, maintainers, and organizers without replacing their judgment.

## Why communities need better instrumentation

Most communities run on gut feel and reactive moderation:

- You see conflicts after they explode.
- You notice cliques only when people stop showing up.
- You guess why newcomers leave, but rarely test it.

Meanwhile, your interaction data (threads, replies, meetings, issues) sits in silos.

Communitas turns those traces into a **living community model** — a dynamic graph of members, topics, and artifacts — and helps you answer questions like:

- Where are we at risk of fragmentation?
- Which people act as bridges across clusters, and are they overloaded?
- How does onboarding affect newcomer retention?
- Are our interventions actually helping, or just adding noise?

## What Communitas does

Communitas focuses on four loops that define community management:

- **Sensemaking**: Build a dynamic, weighted graph from posts, replies, mentions, events, and contributions.
- **Health**: Track interpretable metrics like bridge scarcity, newcomer drop-off, clique lock-in, and moderation hotspots.
- **Intervention**: Suggest small, opt-in actions — introductions, prompts, onboarding steps, norms reminders, recognition.
- **Learning**: Run simple experiments, compare outcomes, and feed results back into your playbooks.

Under the hood, Communitas uses:

- **Network science** to reason about clusters, bridges, and resilience.
- **Language models** to understand conversational patterns and norms.
- **Knowledge graphs and GraphRAG** to ground recommendations in evidence from research and your own decision history.

## Built for legitimacy, not manipulation

AI that quietly steers communities can easily cross ethical lines.

Communitas is designed around:

- **Opt-in participation**: Members can see, configure, and decline AI support.
- **Transparent provenance**: Interventions are clearly labeled.
- **Auditability**: Every AI suggestion and decision path is logged for later review.
- **Augmentation, not replacement**: AI drafts and suggests; humans decide and act.

We explicitly avoid dark patterns and "growth hacks" that optimize for engagement at the expense of trust.

## Who Communitas is for

- Workplace and product teams that want healthier cross-team collaboration and onboarding.
- OSS maintainers who need to reduce single-maintainer bottlenecks and support newcomers.
- Online communities and subreddits that want better facilitation and less reactive moderation.
- Art collectives and civic groups that care about participation, inclusion, and long-term resilience.

If you run a community where legitimacy, consent, and long-term health matter more than short-term growth, Communitas is for you.

## Start with a small, safe pilot

You dont have to redesign your whole community.

Most groups start by:

1. Choosing one outcome (e.g., newcomer retention or cross-team collaboration).
2. Selecting one space (a Slack workspace, GitHub org, or subreddit).
3. Running a 4 8 week pilot with a limited set of opt-in interventions.

See [Getting Started: Pilot in Your Community](/getting-started/pilot-in-your-community) for a concrete plan.
