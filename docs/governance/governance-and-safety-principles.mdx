# Governance & Safety Principles

Communitas is built on the assumption that legitimacy and trust are as important as technical performance.

This page outlines the core principles that guide how Communitas should be deployed, configured, and evaluated in real communities.

## Augmentation, not replacement

Humans remain accountable for community decisions. AI systems draft, suggest, and summarize; they do not act autonomously in member-facing spaces.

## Opt-in by design

Members and operators should know that AI systems are involved, what those systems can see and suggest, and how to change their own settings. Undisclosed AI participation is out of scope for Communitas.

## Transparent identity and provenance

Synthetic agents are clearly identified as such. Interventions are labeled with their provenance and, where feasible, key signals and mechanisms.

## Auditability and longitudinal accountability

Every intervention and automated decision path should be logged with enough context to support review, debugging, and longitudinal auditing of behavior over time.

## Explicit boundaries against manipulation

Communitas is not intended for covert persuasion or engagement-at-all-costs optimization. Interventions focus on pro-social goals such as bridging clusters, newcomer support, and conflict de-escalation.

## Data minimization and privacy

Use the minimum data necessary to support the four loops. Prefer aggregated or pseudonymized representations where possible, and design with realistic threat models in mind.

## Participatory governance

Whenever possible, involve representative members in selecting metrics, choosing interventions, and reviewing experiment results. Publish a concise AI assistance charter or policy for your community.

## Handling failures and harm

Plan for incident response, rollbacks, and learning from harm. The standard for success is not perfect predictions, but legible, accountable processes for addressing issues when they arise.
