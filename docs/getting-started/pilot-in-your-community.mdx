# Getting Started: Pilot in Your Community

This guide shows you how to design a safe, focused pilot of Communitas in your community.

It is written for operators such as:

- An OSS maintainer running a GitHub-based project.
- A workplace team lead or head of community running an internal Slack or Teams space.

## 1. Choose a narrow pilot scope

Start small. Pick:

- One primary outcome, such as newcomer retention or cross-team collaboration.
- One pilot environment, such as a single GitHub org or a subset of Slack channels.

Write this down; you will use it to select metrics and experiments.

## 2. Clarify governance, consent, and red lines

Before connecting any data, decide who is accountable for the pilot, what spaces and interventions are in scope, and what is explicitly out of scope.

Communicate clearly to members:

- What data is used.
- What the AI assistant can and cannot do.
- How to opt in, adjust settings, or opt out.

See [Governance & Safety Principles](/governance/governance-and-safety-principles) for patterns and language you can adapt.

## 3. Connect your community data

Depending on your community type, you will typically:

- For OSS projects: connect one organization or repository and ingest issues, pull requests, comments, and reviews.
- For workplace teams: connect one workspace or selected channels and ingest messages, threads, reactions, and events.

In both cases, Communitas constructs a community graph with basic health metrics and a "what changed this week" summary.

## 4. Establish a baseline

Before turning on any interventions, run the Sensemaking and Health loops in observation-only mode for 1 2 weeks and capture a short baseline of metrics and qualitative impressions.

## 5. Pick one experiment template

For a first pilot, use one of the built-in experiment designs: bridge-building, newcomer onboarding, or language facilitation.

Choose the template that aligns with your pilot outcome and norms.

## 6. Configure opt-in interventions

Decide who receives suggestions, how they are delivered, and what controls are available. Start with low frequency and expand only if suggestions are useful.

## 7. Run, monitor, and adjust

During the pilot, review weekly snapshots, check intervention logs, and gather qualitative feedback. Adjust targeting, frequency, or copy as needed.

## 8. Evaluate outcomes and decide next steps

At the end of the pilot, compare pre- and post-pilot metrics, review workload trends, and summarize what worked, what didnt, and open questions.
