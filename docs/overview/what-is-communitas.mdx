# What is Communitas?

Communitas is an AI community manager toolkit that helps you understand, steward, and experiment with your community in a way that is grounded in network science and social computing research.

It is not a chatbot "community manager." Instead, it is infrastructure that supports the humans already doing that work.

## A living model of your community

Communitas builds and maintains a dynamic, weighted, typed graph of your community:

- **Entities**: Members, Threads, Messages, Topics, Events, Artifacts (docs/code), Policies/Norms, Interventions.
- **Edges**: replies_to, mentions, co_attends, co_authors, endorses, moderates, introduces, shares_topic, conflicts_with.
- **Weights**: recency-weighted frequency, reciprocity, sentiment stability, and collaboration outcomes.

This graph is updated over time, so you can ask:

- Which clusters are forming or drifting apart?
- Where do we rely on a few broker nodes as single points of failure?
- How did last months onboarding changes affect newcomer pathways?

## The four loops

Communitas organizes the product around four loops that mirror real community work:

- **Sensemaking**: ingest interaction streams and construct a temporal community graph.
- **Health**: compute interpretable community health metrics.
- **Intervention**: suggest minimal, pro-social actions with clear provenance.
- **Learning**: treat interventions as experiments and update playbooks based on outcomes.

## Research-grounded, product-focused

Communitas borrows from recent work in dynamic social networks, diffusion, language and sense of community, AI governance, and knowledge graphs. These ideas show up as bridge maps, metrics specifications, experiment templates, and a research tap that keeps your playbooks current.
